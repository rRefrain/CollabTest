"Movement was my only tell
Runnin' through the door yelling what the hell
I'm moving while you talk ya talk
Don't talk shit gon' break ya jaw"

"I'm moving up and on the run
Somebody better save me, son
Who cares if ya trace my same steps
Some days I wake up brain dead
Hook me up on life support
Will somebody tell me what I'm fightin' for"

Movement, Oliver Tree
